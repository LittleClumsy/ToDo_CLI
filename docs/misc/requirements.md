# Requirements

## Overview

We use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage our dependencies. This is a great tool that allows us to manage our dependencies in a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` file. The `Pipfile` is used to define the dependencies and the `Pipfile.lock` is used to lock the dependencies to a specific version. This is great for reproducibility and stability.

## Developer Packages
