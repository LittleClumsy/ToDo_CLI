# Pipenv

We use [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage our dependencies. It is a great tool that combines pip and virtualenv into one tool.

## Pipfile

Pipfile is a file that contains all the dependencies of the project. It is similar to the requirements.txt file. The difference is that it can also specify the version of the dependencies. It can also differentiate between dev and user dependencies and lastly, it can specify the python version required for the project.

## requirements.txt

This file is generated by pipenv. This file is generated for users who prefer to use pip and venv instead of pipenv. This file contains all the dependencies of the project.
